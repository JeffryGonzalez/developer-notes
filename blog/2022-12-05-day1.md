# Day one of Intro to Programming Class

A *lot* about .NET and it's history.


.NET is a Microsoft joint. It was released in 2002. In the beginning it was:

- Closed Source (proprietary)
- Targeted Windows *only*
- Required a Windows machine to have the *Common Language Runtime* installed.

It is now:

- Open Source [https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet)
- It is XPlat (Cross-Platform) - runs on Linux (varies distros), MacOS, and Windows
- With MAUI you can create UI applications that run on iOS, Android, Windows, etc. (Not my area, but cool none the less)

## Pieces Parts of .NET

### The Common Language Runtime

A *runtime* is a piece of software that (ahem) "runs" our applications. *Most* .net applications require a runtime. 
Different versions of the runtime exist for different platforms (Linux, etc.) including one that is Web Assembly (which means you can run .NET code IN YOUR FREAKING WEB BROWSER!) - this is called "Blazor WASM"

### The Common Type System

Way more on this coming, but it says that there are two basic "first class" citizens in .NET (that is something that can have a variable refere to it.)

They are:

- Value Types
- Reference Types


### The Framework Class Library

The big bundle of .NET Types (see above) provided by Microsoft for developing applications. Everything from the `System.Int32` type to the `WebApplication`.

### What did we do?

Created a console application. Talked about Solutions a bit, and Projects.

Projects compile to an *Assembly*. An *Assembly* is the "unit of compilation" in .NET, and they contain the compiled IL code, and the "metadata" - a database of the types contained in that assembly.

We used the .NET SDK tool called "ILDASM" (the "intermediate language disssassembler") to peer into a compiled assembly. Because it is cool and hackerish. You won't need to do this often.

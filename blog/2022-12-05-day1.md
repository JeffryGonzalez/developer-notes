- What I learned today?
- What do you remember that you *think* is important.
    - What is the CLR?
    - What is IL code?
    - What is the entry point for a .net application?
    - What is ".Net Core" and why was it important?
    - Anything else?


- What I need to learn more about 
    - Dude, Git? Never done it! What the heck!
    - What the heck is an "HTTP API?"


```csharp
using HelloWorld;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// do some configuration of the services (none for this one now)
builder.Services.AddSingleton<DateUtils>();
var app = builder.Build();

// Route Parameter
app.MapGet("/break/{minutes:int}", (int minutes, DateUtils utils) =>
{
    var response = new BreakTimerResponse(
        minutes,
        DateTime.Now,
        utils.TakeABreak(minutes)
        );
    return Results.Ok(response);
});

app.Run(); // "Blocking"

```
